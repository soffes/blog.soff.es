    <h2>Archive</h2>
    <p>These are all of the posts Iâ€™ve written that I still have. Some old ones are lost forever, but I saved what I could find. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060414170216/http://samsoffes.com/" rel="external nofollow">Archive.org</a>, there are older ones, but they are likely lost forever. The stuff towards the bottom is pretty cringey after all of this time anyway. Enjoy.</p>
